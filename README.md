ðŸš§ *This project is under construction* ðŸš§



## About The Project

> [!NOTE]  
> The name comes from one of the API endpoint called stargazer *(= all the people that starred a repo)*, combined with GH for GitHub initials

This project allows you to track some statistics of a GitHub repo using GitHub's Rest API

No authentication is needed
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The API rate limit is 60 call/hour so if you start the main program to many times, you might end-up being blocked for an hour
